# ci-riddle-me-this
This is the Riddle me this game required for module 7 Practical Python

## Task Description
In this project, youâ€™ll be building a logic-driven application using the 
technologies that you have learned throughout Practical Python. You can either
choose to use the example brief below or choose to use your idea for the 
website.

CREATE A 'RIDDLE-ME-THIS' GUESSING GAME
Build a web application game that asks players to guess the answer to a
pictorial or text-based riddle.
The player is presented with an image or text that contains the riddle. Players 
enter their answer into a textarea and submit their answer using a form.
If a player guesses correctly, they are redirected to the next riddle.
If a player guesses incorrectly, their incorrect guess is stored and printed 
below the riddle. The textarea is cleared so they can guess again.
Multiple players can play an instance of the game at the same time, each in 
their own browser. Users are identified by a unique username, but note that no 
authentication features such as a password are required for this project.
Create a leaderboard that ranks top scores for all (at least recent) users.
